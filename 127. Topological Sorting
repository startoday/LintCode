Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.

#拓扑排序，排序入度为0的 消除哈， 一般是有向无环图 BFS哈 
#O（N） 没有重复点
